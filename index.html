             <p>Hello!</p>
             <p> My name is August Murphy-Beach. I am currently attending Gonzaga University, studying Computer Science, Leadership, and Spanish. With this website, I hope to hone my web development and design skills, and have fun doing it! My passions are fitness, computers, and design.</p>
             <p>I am particularly in software design and construction, and I hope to one day be a software engineer or in software leadership at a technologically-focused copmany.  I'm very detail-oriented, and I believe that a project is only truly done when its been perfected.</p>
             <p>Recently, I took a course in data visualization, which piqued my interest. Although the content of the course was relatively basic, I would like to futher explore how visualizations can be created to help both front-end users and software designers see information in a new way. My final project for the class compiled all of Major League Baseball's pitching data into a "pitcher's guide", allowing to view batters' weak zones per hit type. </p>
