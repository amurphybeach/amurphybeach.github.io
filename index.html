             <p>Hello! My name is August Murphy-Beach. I am currently attending Gonzaga University, studying Computer Science, Leadership, and Spanish. With this website, I hope to hone my web development and design skills, and have fun doing it! My passions are fitness, computers, and design.</p>
             <p>I am particularly intrigued by the integration of graphic design into computer programming, especially in the creation of user-friendly interfaces. I have a minimalist design philosophy, and I'm always happy to give a loud constructive critique of crowded design.</p>
             <p>Additionally, what interests me most is computational modeling. Finding ways to model real events through data has sparked my interest in Computer Science. My most recent model, Hillclimbr, allows the user to get a real depiction of how they match up to cycling's greats. I hope to export Hillclimbr to a mobile application, to be used as a theoretical time-up-hill calculator for a cyclist's favorite climb.</p>
