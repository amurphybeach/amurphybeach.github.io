             <p>Hello! My name is August Murphy-Beach. I am currently attending Gonzaga University, studying Computer Science, Leadership, and Spanish. With this website, I hope to hone my web development and design skills, and have fun doing it! My passions are fitness, computers, and design.</p>
             <p>I am particularly in software design and construction, and I hope to one day be a software engineer at a technologically-focused copmany.  I'm very detail-oriented, and I believe that a project is only truly done when its been perfected.</p>
             <p>Recently, I took a course in computational modeling, which piqued my interest. Although the content of the course was relatively basic, I would like to futher explore how modeling can be used to model real events. My Final Project for computational modeling, HillClimbr allows the user to get a real depiction of how they match up to cycling's greats. I hope to export Hillclimbr to a mobile application, to be used as a theoretical time-up-hill calculator for a cyclist's favorite climb.</p>
