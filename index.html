             <p>Hello! My name is August Murphy-Beach. I am currently attending Gonzaga University, studying Computer Science, Leadership, and Spanish. With this website, I hope to hone my web development skills, and have fun doing it! My passions are fitness, computers, and tennis.</p>
             <p>In my studies, what interests me most is computational modeling. Finding ways to model real events through data has sparked my interest in Computer Science. My most recent model, Hillclimbr, allows the user to get a real depiction of how fast they'd be racing the greats in cycling. I hope to export Hillclimbr to a mobile application, in order to further develop my skills with computers.</p>
